# Autocomplete Items

Suggestions that are shown in the autocomplete results are called `items`.  `items` can be full product names (with metadata including images and descriptions) or simple search terms.

Most users prefer to leverage our bulk methods below, which allow adding, updating, or removing up to 1,000 items at a time.
