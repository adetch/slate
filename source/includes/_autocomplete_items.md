# Autocomplete Items

Suggestions that are shown in the autocomplete results are called `items`.  `items` can be full product names (with metadata including images and descriptions) or simple search terms.

## Add an Item

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"item_name":"power drill","keywords":["battery-powered","drills","drywall"],
  "suggested_score":36,"url":"http://www.mysite.com/power_drill","autocomplete_section":"Search Suggestions"}' \
  -u"[your token]:" "https://ac.cnstrc.com/v1/item?autocomplete_key=[your autocomplete key]"
```

```javascript
constructorio.add(
  { item_name: "power drill", autocomplete_section: "Search Suggestions" },
  function(error, response) {
    if (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  }
);
```

```ruby
response = constructorio.add(
  { item_name: "power drill", autocomplete_section: "Search Suggestions" }
);
```

```python
response = constructor_instance.add(
    item_name="power drill",
    autocomplete_section="Search Suggestions")
```

```php
<?php
$response = $constructor->add(
  "power drill", // item name
  "Search Suggestions" // autocomplete section name
);
```

```perl
my $response = $constructorio->add(
  item_name => "power drill",
  autocomplete_section => "Search Suggestions"
);
```

```java
boolean success = constructorio.add("power drill", "Search Suggestions");
// power drill is an item name
// Search Suggestions is an autocomplete section name
```

```csharp
ListItem item = new ListItem(
  Name: "Power drill",
  Description: "Like a drill, with power.",
  URL: "http://constructor.io/power-drill",
  ImageURL: "http://constructor.io/power-drill.jpg",
  AutocompleteSection: "Products"
);

bool success = ConstructorIOAPI.Add(item);

// "item" is a ListItem containing key / value pairs as specified in parameters below.
```

> The above command returns a 204 Success response on success.

To add an item to your autocomplete index, use the `POST /item` call. The `item_name` is required. You can also pass in an optional `suggested_score` between 1-100, which will influence the item's initial ranking relative to other item scores (the higher the score, the higher in the list of suggestions the item will appear). You can also optionally pass in the item's `keywords` to give us more meta information and help us better determine how and where to display the item when autocompleting. If you would like to add an item that points to a direct link, just pass in that link as a `url`. Finally, because your autocomplete can have multiple sections, like categories, search suggestions, and direct links to products, you must specify which section you are adding an item to. You can do this with the `autocomplete_section` parameter.

### HTTP Request

`POST https://ac.cnstrc.com/v1/item?autocomplete_key=[your autocomplete key]`

### JSON Parameters

Parameter | Required? | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
item_name | Yes | The name of the item, as it will appear in the autocomplete suggestions
autocomplete_section | Yes | Your autocomplete suggestions can have multiple sections like "Products" and "Search Suggestions".  This indicates which section this item is for.  See [your dashboard](/dashboard) for the section names to use.
suggested_score | No | A number between 1-100 that will influence the item's initial ranking relative to other item scores (the higher the score, the higher in the list of suggestions the item will appear)
keywords | No | An array of keywords for this item.  Keywords are useful if you want a product name to appear when a user enters a searchterm that isn't in the product name iteslf.
url | No | A URL to directly send the user after selecting the item
image_url | No | A URL that points to an image you'd like displayed next to some item (only applicable when url is supplied)
description | No | A description for some item (only applicable when url is supplied)

## Add or Update an Item

```shell
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"item_name":"power drill","keywords":["battery-powered","drills","drywall"],
  "suggested_score":36,"url":"http://www.mysite.com/power_drill","autocomplete_section":"Search Suggestions"}' \
  -u"[your token]:" "https://ac.cnstrc.com/v1/item?force=1&autocomplete_key=[your autocomplete key]"
```

```javascript
constructorio.add_or_update(
  { item_name: "power drill", autocomplete_section: "Search Suggestions" },
  function(error, response) {
    if (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  }

```ruby
response = constructorio.add_or_update(
  { item_name: "power drill", autocomplete_section: "Search Suggestions" }
);
```

```python
response = constructor_instance.add_or_update(
    item_name="power drill",
    autocomplete_section="Search Suggestions")
```

```php
<?php
$response = $constructor->addOrUpdate(
  "power drill", // item name
  "Search Suggestions" // autocomplete section name
);
```

```perl
my $response = $constructorio->add_or_update(
  item_name => "power drill",

```

```csharp
ListItem item = new ListItem(
  Name: "Power drill",
  Description: "Like a drill, with power.",
  URL: "http://constructor.io/power-drill",
  ImageURL: "http://constructor.io/power-drill.jpg",
  AutocompleteSection: "Products"
);

bool success = ConstructorIOAPI.AddOrUpdate(item);

// "item" is a ListItem containing key / value pairs as specified in parameters below. If an item with the name "Power drill" already exists, its Description, Url and ImageUrl will be updated as indicated. Otherwise a new item will be created with these values.
```


 > The above commands return a 204 Success response on success.

An add or update operation (also known as an `UPSERT`) updates an item in your autocomplete index if it already exists, or adds the item to your index if it does not yet exist. 

To add or update an item in your autocomplete index, use the `POST /item` call, with `?force=1`. Options are the same as for the standard `Add an Item` call: `item_name` and `autocomplete_section` are required and all other parameters are optional.

We determine whether an item already exists based on the optional `id` set for the item, or if not present, the `item_name` and `autocomplete_section`.

### HTTP Request

`PUT https://ac.cnstrc.com/v1/item?force=1&autocomplete_key=[your autocomplete key]`

### JSON Parameters

Parameter | Required? | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
item_name | Yes | The name of the item, as it will appear in the autocomplete suggestions
autocomplete_section | Yes | Your autocomplete suggestions can have multiple sections like "Products" and "Search Suggestions".  This indicates which section this item is for.  See [your dashboard](/dashboard) for the section names to use.
suggested_score | No | A number between 1-100 that will influence the item's initial ranking relative to other item scores (the higher the score, the higher in the list of suggestions the item will appear)
keywords | No | An array of keywords for this item.  Keywords are useful if you want a product name to appear when a user enters a searchterm that isn't in the product name iteslf.
url | No | A URL to directly send the user after selecting the item
image_url | No | A URL that points to an image you'd like displayed next to some item (only applicable when url is supplied)
description | No | A description for some item (only applicable when url is supplied)
id | No | An arbitrary ID you would like associated with this item.  You can use this field to store your own IDs of the items to more easily access them in other API calls.

## Batch Add Items

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"items": [ {"item_name": "power drill"}, {"item_name": "hammer"} ],
    "autocomplete_section":"Search Suggestions"}' \
  -u"[your token]:" "https://ac.cnstrc.com/v1/batch_items?autocomplete_key=[your autocomplete key]"

      { item_name: "hammer" }
    ],
    autocomplete_section: "Search Suggestions"
  },
  function(error, response) {
    if (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  }
);
```

```ruby
response = constructorio.add_batch(
  {
    items: [
      { item_name: "power drill" },
      { item_name: "hammer" }
    ],
    autocomplete_section: "Search Suggestions"
  }
);
```

```python
# This method is not currently supported in our python client.
```

```php
<?php
$response = $constructor->addBatch(
  array("power drill", "hammer"),
  "Search Suggestions"
);

$toolBox = array(
   array("item_name" => "power drill", "url" => "/products/power-drill", "image_url" => "/images/power-drill.jpg"),
   array("item_name" => "hammer", "url" => "/products/hammer", "image_url" => "/images/hammer.jpg")
);
$response = $constructor->addBatch($toolBox, "Products");
```

```perl
my $response = $constructorio->add_batch(
  items => [ { item_name => "power drill" }, { item_name => "hammer" } ],
  autocomplete_section => "Search Suggestions"
);
```

```java
boolean success = constructorio.addBatch("Search Suggestions", "power drill", "hammer");
// "Search Suggestions" is an autocomplete section name
// power drill is an item name
// hammer is an item name
```

```csharp
List<ListItem> itemList = new List<ListItem>();

itemList.Add(new ListItem(
  Name: "Power drill",
  Description: "Like a drill, with power.",
  URL: "http://constructor.io/power-drill",
  ImageURL: "http://constructor.io/power-drill.jpg"

// "Products" is the  autocomplete section to which you'd like to add the items contained in itemList
```

> The above command(s) return a 204 Success response on success.

To add multiple items to your autocomplete index as a batch, use the `POST /batch_items` call. The `items` parameter is required and is a list of items with the same attributes as defined in the [Add an Item](#add-an-item) resource.  Because your autocomplete can have multiple sections, like categories, search suggestions, and direct links to products, you must specify which section you are adding an item to. You can do this with the `autocomplete_section` parameter.

### JSON Parameters

Parameter | Required? | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
items | Yes | A list of items with the same attributes as defined in the [Add an Item](#add-an-item) resource

A batch add or update allows you to add a group of items to your autocomplete without first checking to make sure no item in the batch already exists.

Any items that don't already exist are created, and any items that already exist are updated. This is also known as an `UPSERT` operation.

To add or update a batch of items to your autocomplete index, use the `PUT /batch_items` call, with `?force=1`. Options are the same as for the standard `Batch Add Items` call: `item_name` and `autocomplete_section` are required and all other parameters are optional.

We determine whether items already exist based on the `item_name` and `autocomplete_section` set for each item. However, if the optional `id` parameter is set for the items, we determine whether items already exist using this parameter.

### HTTP Request

`PUT https://ac.cnstrc.com/v1/batch_items?force=1&autocomplete_key=[your autocomplete key]`

### JSON Parameters

Parameter | Required? | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
autocomplete_section | Yes | Your autocomplete suggestions can have multiple sections like "Products" and "Search Suggestions".  This indicates which section this item is for.  See [your dashboard](/dashboard) for the section names to use.
items | Yes | A list of items with the same attributes as defined in the [Add an Item](#add-an-item) resource

  -u "[your token]:" "https://ac.cnstrc.com/v1/item?autocomplete_key=[your autocomplete key]"
```

```javascript
constructorio.modify(
  {
    item_name: "power drill",
    new_item_name: "super power drill",
    autocomplete_section: "Search Suggestions",
    url: "http://www.mysite.com/power_drill",
  },
  function(error, response) {
    if (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  }
);
```

```ruby
response = constructorio.modify(
  {

```

```python
response = constructor_instance.modify(
    item_name="power drill",
    new_item_name="better power drill",
    autocomplete_section="Search Suggestions",
    url="http://www.mysite.com/power_drill")
```

```php
<?php
$response = $constructor->modify(
  "power drill", // item name
  "super power drill", // new item name (this is required)
  "Search Suggestions", // autocomplete section name
  array("suggested_score" => 100) // array of item properties to modify
);
```

```perl
my $response = $constructorio->modify(
  item_name => "power drill",
  new_item_name => "super power drill",
  autocomplete_section => "Search Suggestions",
  url => "http://www.mysite.com/power_drill"
);
```

```java
boolean success = constructorio.modify("power drill", "super power drill", "Search Suggestions", paramMap);
// power drill is an item name
// super power drill is an item name
// Search Suggestions is an autocomplete section name
// paramMap is a Map<String, Object> you filled beforehand with the other properties you want to modify. Optional.
```

```csharp
ListItem item = new ListItem(
  Name: "Drill",
  URL: "http://constructor.io/drill",
  AutocompleteSection: "Products"
);

item.Name = "Power drill";
item.Description = "Like a drill, with power."

// "Drill" is the original item name as you previously saved it in our system
// "Power drill" is the new item name
// "Description" is a new description to add for the item
```

> The above command returns a 204 Success response on success.

To modify an item already in your autocomplete index, use the `PUT /item` call. The `item_name` is required. You can also pass in an optional `suggested_score` between 1-100, which will influence the item's initial ranking relative to other item scores (the higher the score, the higher in the list of suggestions the item will appear). You can also optionally pass in the item's `keywords` to give us more meta information and help us better determine how and where to display the item when autocompleting. If the item should point to a direct link, just pass in that link as a `url`. Finally, because your autocomplete can have multiple sections, like categories, search suggestions, and direct links to products, you must specify in which section you are modifying an item. You can do this with the `autocomplete_section` parameter.

Note: modifying an item replaces all meta information, such as keywords, we previously had on the item, but does not update the score unless you provide a new suggested_score.
