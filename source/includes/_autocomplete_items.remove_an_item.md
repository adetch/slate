To remove an item from your autocomplete index (if, for instance, a product has been discontinued), issue a `DELETE /item` call. Note: this will remove all meta-information such as keywords we currently have on the item. If your autocomplete has multiple sections (i.e. products, categories, and search suggestions), you must specify the name of the autocomplete section from which you're removing an item.
